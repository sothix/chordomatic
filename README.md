### How do I get set up? ###

* Summary of set up

You don't even need a web server you can download this and display in your favourite (up-to-date) browser. The main code is in chordomatic.html so you can adjust any of the links for you own particular lessons. 

If you wish to add any extra instruments you will need to modify the database[] array. 
Just include the image of the neck and add it with the points for the strings and frets. You can use get_coordinates.html to set up the points by clicking on the image. (not for the feint of heart - however if you understand code then get_coordinates.html will help a lot).
